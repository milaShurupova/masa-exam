		    if (expectedMonth  >  12) {
		        expectedMonth = expectedMonth % 12;

		    if (expectedMonth  <  0) {
		        expectedMonth += 12;
	        }
    
		    date.setMonth(date.getMonth() + value);
	        const daysToAdd: number = date.getMonth() >  expectedMonth ? -1 : 1;
	        while (date.getMonth() !== expectedMonth) {
		        date.setDate(date.getDate() + daysToAdd);
		    }
